## what this does

this website displays the following stimuli, each for a duration of 1 minute:

1. version 1
    1. A wheel-like pattern that spins clockwise, starting with an angular speed of 360° s<sup>-1</sup> and ending with an angular speed of 1260° s<sup>-1</sup>, with an increase in angular speed of 30° s<sup>-1</sup> at intervals of 2s.
    2. A wheel-like  pattern that spins clockwise with a constant angular speed of 720° s<sup>-1</sup>.
    3. A wheel-like  pattern that is motionless (i.e. has constant angular speed of 0° s<sup>-1</sup>).
2. version 2
    1. A pink dot that spins clockwise, starting with an angular speed of 360° s<sup>-1</sup> and has a reduction in angular period by 0.01s after every complete rotation.
    2. A pink dot that spins clockwise with a constant angular speed of 720° s<sup>-1</sup>.
    3. A pink dot that is motionless (i.e. has constant angular speed of 0° s<sup>-1</sup>).
3. version 3
    1. A 2-D pattern that spins clockwise, starting with an angular speed of 80° s<sup>-1</sup> and ending with an angular speed of 128° s<sup>-1</sup>, with an increase in angular speed of 16° s<sup>-1</sup> and 32° s<sup>-1</sup> at 20s and 40s interval respectively.
    2. A 2-D pattern that spins clockwise with a constant angular speed of 96° s<sup>-1</sup>.
    3. A 2-D pattern that is motionless (i.e. has constant angular speed of 0° s<sup>-1</sup>).
